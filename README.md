# MERN Stack Hospital Management System

I created a dynamic MERN Stack Hospital Management System from scratch using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The system offers a powerful platform for both patients and administrators, focusing on both the backend server and a user-friendly frontend interface. This project equips me with the skills to build professional-grade management systems.
